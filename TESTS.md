# Test Suite Guide

This document provides a detailed description of every test case in the project. It is organized by test file and mirrors the intent, setup, procedure, and expected outcomes for each case. All unit tests live under `tests/unit`. Some UI-centric tests are compiled only on non-Windows platforms and use the Qt offscreen platform plugin so they can run without a visible display.

## How to run tests
- Configure tests (once): `cmake -S app -B build-tests -DAI_FILE_SORTER_BUILD_TESTS=ON -DAI_FILE_SORTER_REQUIRE_MEDIAINFOLIB=ON`
- Build and run all tests: `cmake --build build-tests` then `ctest --test-dir build-tests --output-on-failure -j $(nproc)`
- Run a single test case by name: `./build-tests/ai_file_sorter_tests "<test case name or pattern>"`
- Run GUI test mode: `./build-tests/aifilesorter --test`
- Run production-binary self-tests: `./build-tests/aifilesorter --self-test` or `./build-tests/aifilesorter --self-test=whitelist`
- MediaInfo is expected from a package manager (`apt`/`dnf`/`pacman`/`brew`/`vcpkg`); vendored MediaInfo directories/binaries are intentionally rejected by the build.

## App test modes

The production executable supports two developer-oriented test modes:

- `--test` launches the normal GUI, implies development mode, and adds a Tests menu. The current GUI preset creates a larger sample whitelist and sample files, then runs the normal analysis flow with the selected real LLM for manual review in the Review dialog. It reuses the user's selected LLM settings, but test-mode whitelists, categorization cache, learned behavior, undo data, and sample files are stored under an isolated `test_mode_profile` directory inside the normal config directory.
- `--self-test` runs deterministic headless checks and exits with a pass/fail status. The current suite is `whitelist`, which builds large synthetic whitelists in a temporary config directory and verifies compact prompt candidate selection, learned-category preference, and Unicode whitelist labels. `--self-test` runs all available suites; `--self-test=whitelist` and `--self-test=whitelists` select only the whitelist suite.

## Unit test catalog

Procedure: Build the categorization user prompt through the local LLM test access layer for both files.
Expected outcome: Both prompts start with the document-specific instruction text, include file name and path, keep the shared guidance, and omit the generic `Full path:` framing; only the summarized file includes a `Document summary:` line.
Run: `./build-tests/ai_file_sorter_tests "Document categorization uses a document-specific user prompt"`

#### Test case: Generic file categorization user prompt includes explicit answer format
Purpose: Keep the generic file prompt short while still forcing the model back into the strict `<Main category> : <Subcategory>` response shape.
Setup: Provide a representative software-like file name and a sample allowed-main-category block.
Procedure: Build the generic categorization user prompt through the local LLM test access layer.
Expected outcome: The prompt includes the full path, file name, allowed main categories, and an explicit one-line answer template.
Run: `./build-tests/ai_file_sorter_tests "Generic file categorization user prompt includes explicit answer format"`

### `tests/unit/test_single_instance_coordinator.cpp`

#### Test case: SingleInstanceCoordinator notifies the primary instance on relaunch
Purpose: Verify that a second launch notifies the already running primary process instead of becoming a second app instance.
Setup: Create a writable temporary runtime directory, point `AI_FILE_SORTER_SINGLE_INSTANCE_RUNTIME_DIR` at it, start one coordinator as the primary instance, and install an activation callback on it.
Procedure: Verify local socket binding is available, then start a second coordinator with the same instance id and wait for the primary callback to fire.
Expected outcome: When local sockets are available, the second coordinator reports that it is not primary and the first coordinator receives exactly the relaunch activation request. If the sandbox cannot bind local sockets, the test records that the activation handoff is skipped.
Run: `./build-tests/ai_file_sorter_tests "SingleInstanceCoordinator notifies the primary instance on relaunch"`

#### Test case: SingleInstanceCoordinator allows different instance ids to coexist
Purpose: Ensure the coordinator only deduplicates launches that share the same logical app id.
Setup: Create a writable temporary runtime directory, point `AI_FILE_SORTER_SINGLE_INSTANCE_RUNTIME_DIR` at it, and create two coordinators with different unique instance ids.
Procedure: Acquire the primary-instance lock for both coordinators.
Expected outcome: Both coordinators become primary because they represent different logical applications.
Run: `./build-tests/ai_file_sorter_tests "SingleInstanceCoordinator allows different instance ids to coexist"`

Procedure: Toggle the "Analyze picture files" checkbox on, then toggle the "Do not categorize picture files" checkbox on and attempt to unset "Offer to rename picture files".
Expected outcome: The option group enables when analysis is checked; enabling rename-only forces offer-rename on; disabling offer-rename clears rename-only.
Run: `./build-tests/ai_file_sorter_tests "Image analysis checkboxes enable and enforce rename-only behavior"`

#### Test case: Top-level analysis rows share the same leading edge
Purpose: Verify that top-level analysis controls align consistently in the main window.

Expected outcome: Each non-retryable startup failure returns false.
Run: `./build-tests/ai_file_sorter_tests "Visual CPU fallback detection ignores non-retryable startup failures"`

#### Test case: Visual CPU fallback decline requests analysis cancellation
Purpose: Confirm cancelling the visual CPU retry prompt stops the whole analysis instead of continuing with filename-based categorization.
Setup: Build `MainApp` with an override that declines the visual CPU fallback prompt.
Procedure: Invoke the visual CPU fallback prompt path twice.

Procedure: Clear those targets and observe the callback flags.
Expected outcome: The callbacks are invoked and the operations report success.
Run: `./build-tests/ai_file_sorter_tests "CacheMaintenanceService uses specialized clear callbacks when provided"`

#### Test case: CacheMaintenanceService reports zero size for an empty categorization database
Purpose: Prevent the categorization cache UI from showing the baseline SQLite schema size after the cache has already been cleared.
Setup: Create a real empty `file_categorization` SQLite database on disk and vacuum it so the file still has a non-zero on-disk size.
Procedure: Query the categorization target through `target_info()`.
Expected outcome: The target still exists on disk, but the reported reclaimable size is `0`, reflecting that no cached categorization rows remain.
Run: `./build-tests/ai_file_sorter_tests "CacheMaintenanceService reports zero size for an empty categorization database"`

### `tests/unit/test_user_learning_store.cpp`

#### Test case: UserLearningStore records approved mappings in a separate database
Purpose: Verify user-approved categorization behavior is persisted outside disposable categorization caches.
Setup: Create a temporary config directory and open `UserLearningStore`.
Procedure: Record an approved mapping, then query the learned taxonomy entry and approved examples.

Run: `./build-tests/ai_file_sorter_tests "UserLearningStore records approved mappings in a separate database"`

#### Test case: UserLearningStore updates repeated approvals without duplicating examples
Purpose: Ensure repeated approval for the same file key updates the learned mapping instead of growing duplicate examples.
Setup: Create a learning store and record one approved mapping for a file.
Procedure: Record another mapping for the same file key with a different approved category/subcategory.
Expected outcome: The example count remains one, the old taxonomy entry count is refreshed, and the example points at the latest approved taxonomy entry.

Run: `./build-tests/ai_file_sorter_tests "UserLearningStore imports whitelist taxonomy candidates without duplicating entries"`

#### Test case: UserLearningStore stores embeddings for imported taxonomy candidates
Purpose: Verify user taxonomy entries receive persisted embedding vectors immediately after import.
Setup: Import a taxonomy candidate into a fresh learning store.
Procedure: Load the taxonomy entry's embedding record.
Expected outcome: The embedding uses the active local model id, expected dimension, non-empty source hash, and is counted in the learning database.
Run: `./build-tests/ai_file_sorter_tests "UserLearningStore stores embeddings for imported taxonomy candidates"`

#### Test case: UserLearningStore preserves review-confirmed taxonomy source during whitelist import
Purpose: Ensure later whitelist imports do not downgrade a category that was explicitly confirmed by the user.
Setup: Import a whitelist candidate, then record an approved mapping for the same category.
Procedure: Import the same whitelist candidate again and inspect the learned taxonomy entry.
Expected outcome: The taxonomy entry keeps source `review_confirmed`, retains its approved example count, and is not duplicated.
Run: `./build-tests/ai_file_sorter_tests "UserLearningStore preserves review-confirmed taxonomy source during whitelist import"`

### `tests/unit/test_storage_plugin_dialog.cpp`

#### Test case: StoragePluginDialog refreshes plugin metadata on open and shows update actions
Purpose: Ensure opening the plugin dialog refreshes remote metadata in the background and exposes per-plugin update actions.
Setup: Install a mock external-process plugin locally and provide a mock remote catalog entry advertising a newer version.
Procedure: Construct the dialog, pump events until the background refresh completes, and inspect the plugin list row.
Expected outcome: The installed plugin becomes updateable and its row shows an `Update` action button.

### Test infrastructure: `tests/unit/test_cli_reporter.cpp`

This file registers a Catch2 event listener that prints a one-line "[TEST]" banner for each test case as it begins. It does not define test cases itself, but it makes CLI output easier to follow during long runs.
