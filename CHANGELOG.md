# Changelog

## [1.8.0] - 2026-04-23

- Added backend status indicator to the status bar.
- The app now runs as a single instance - opening it again brings the existing window to the front instead of starting a second copy.
- Restored the app launcher for the non-Microsoft Store versions of the app and improved GPU selection, now preferring CUDA over Vulkan when both are available.
- Improved local GPU startup and local visual model handling for better reliability and compatibility.
- Added Gemma 3 4B IT and set it as the default visual model.
- Added Gemma 3 4B IT and Gemma 1.1 7B as built-in local categorization model choices, replacing LLaMa 3B.
- Improved image categorization quality and consistency by preserving image descriptions, using richer prompt context, adding special handling for screenshots and UI captures, and reducing drift equivalent between  category labels.
- Improved image analysis stability, fallback behavior, and model-download validation.
- Added options to clear categorization and app caches, including a deeper reset of stored categorization state.
- Added local learning from your review decisions to improve future suggestions.
- Added localized Quick Start help, an FAQ link, and Hindi interface support.

## [1.7.3] - 2026-03-22

- Non-English categorization is now more reliable: files are categorized canonically in English first, then translated into the selected category language, with localized labels persisted separately from the canonical taxonomy/cache.
- App updates now support separate update streams for Windows, macOS, and Linux, while still accepting the legacy single-stream manifest format for newer clients.
- Windows feeds can now provide a direct installer URL plus SHA-256 checksum so the app can download the installer, show download progress, verify its integrity, and launch it after confirmation.
- The UI translation system was migrated fully to Qt `.ts` / `.qm` catalogs.
- Local categorization with local LLMs is now more robust: prompt budgeting, output sanitization, and category/subcategory parsing were hardened so verbose or oddly formatted replies no longer cause widespread invalid categorization failures.
- Recursive scans now tolerate unreadable subfolders and other filesystem errors instead of aborting the overall run.
- Cached category labels are sanitized more aggressively to avoid malformed UTF-8 data breaking later categorization or display.
- macOS local-LLM packaging/runtime handling was hardened: bundled llama/ggml dylibs are now relocatable, and the app no longer falls back to conflicting system/Homebrew ggml libraries during backend loading.
- Linux/macOS build and packaging flows were improved, including staged PDFium runtime files, better Debian package dependencies, CPU/CUDA/Vulkan Debian package variants, and improved Homebrew MediaInfo detection on macOS source builds.
- Added cross-platform diagnostics collection scripts for Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- Misc improvements.
- Misc bug fixes.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-03-08

- Progress dialog redesigned into a stage-based table view with explicit stages for Image analysis, Document analysis, and Categorization.
- Added an image analysis option to append image creation dates (if available) to category names.
- Added optional audio/video metadata-based filename suggestions for supported media files. When enabled, AI File Sorter can use embedded tags (such as ID3, Vorbis comments, and MP4-style metadata) to propose normalized names like `year_artist_album_title.ext` during review.
- Bug fixes.

## [1.6.1] - 2026-02-06

- Local text LLM now prompts to switch to CPU when GPU initialization or inference fails.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-02-04

- Added document content analysis (text LLM) with rename-only/document-only options and optional creation-date suffixes for categories. Supported document formats include PDF, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, ODT, ODS, and ODP (plus common text formats).
- Local 3B model download now defaults to Q4 for better GPU compatibility. The legacy Local 3B Q8 is still selectable when an existing download is found.
- Improved the LLM selection dialog latency.
- Added custom API endpoints to the Select LLM dialog. Custom endpoints accept base URLs or full /chat/completions endpoints, with optional API keys for local servers.
- LLM-derived categorizations and rename suggestions are now saved as you go, so progress isn't lost if the app closes unexpectedly.
- Image analysis now falls back (with a user prompt) to CPU if the GPU has insufficient available memory.
- Review dialog now lets you select highlighted rows and bulk edit their categories.
- Review dialog is now scrollable on smaller screens so action buttons stay visible.
- Improved subcategory consistency by merging labels that only differ by generic suffixes (e.g., “files”).
- Added a system compatibility check (benchmarking) to determine the most suitable LLM for your system.
- Added Korean as an interface language.
- macOS builds now include variant `make` targets for Apple Silicon (M1 / M2-M3) and Intel outputs, plus improved arch-aware llama.cpp builds.
- UI, stability, persistence, and usability improvements.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-01-11

- Added content analysis for picture files via LLaVA (visual LLM), with separate model + mmproj downloads in the Select LLM dialog.
- Added image analysis options in the main window (analyze images, offer rename suggestions, rename-only mode).
- Added an image-only processing toggle to focus runs on supported picture files and disable standard categorization controls.
- Added document content analysis (text LLM) with rename-only/document-only modes and optional creation-date suffixes for categories.
- Added support for document formats including PDF, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, ODT, ODS, and ODP (plus common text formats).
- Document analysis now uses embedded PDFium/libzip/pugixml in bundled builds (no pdftotext/unzip requirement).
- Review dialog now supports rename-only flows, suggested filename edits, and status labels for Renamed / Renamed & Moved.
- Track applied picture renames so already-renamed files are not reprocessed; rename-only review hides them while categorization review keeps them visible for folder moves.
- Added Dutch as a selectable interface language.
- Analysis progress dialog output is now fully localized (status tags, scan/process lines, and file/directory labels) to match the selected UI language.
- Build/test updates: mtmd progress callback auto-detection, mtmd-cli build fix, and new Catch2 tests for rename-only caching.

## [1.4.5] - 2025-12-05

- Fixed compile under Arch Linux.

## [1.4.0] - 2025-12-05

- Added dry run / preview-only mode with From/To table, no moves performed until you uncheck.
- Persistent Undo: the latest sort saves a plan file; use Edit -> "Undo last run" even after closing dialogs.
- UI tweaks: Name column auto-resizes, new translations for dry run/undo strings, Undo moved to top of Edit menu.
- A few more guard rails added.
- Remote LLM flow now uses your own OpenAI API key (any ChatGPT model supported); the bundled remote key and obfuscation step were removed.

## [1.3.0] - 2025-11-21
